### DotDev PHP Developer Assessment

The goal of assessment is to test you skills in data structures and formatting.

We have created three data objects `customers`, `orders` and `order_items` in `function loadData()`.

The application should take and integer from stdin or a query string parameter in a web browser and return the approriately formatted data type using data from all three objects.

**Your task is to:**

- Update the function `formatData` to complete the data formatting task.
- Update `$run` to determine if the program is run via the CLI or browser
- You can either create a git repo and send us the link or provide a copy of your git log.

- Do **NOT** use a framework. We want to see your handle of PHP, not how well you can use a framework.
- If you use any modules from composer document your reasoning why you chose the package in the `remarks` section of the code.
- ***The data may not be formatted correctly** Document any errors in the `remarks` section
- The application only needs to run on PHP 7 or higher.

### Usage:
